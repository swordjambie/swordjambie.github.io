           <p class="yahoo">Hello my name is Jay nice to meet you! I am 15 years old and I am attending the international school name American STEM PREP. Our science fair is called the effecinity of the wind turbine.</p>
        <h3 class="kimochi">Stem Fair Engineering Design Process</h3>
        <p class="yahoo">Our Problem in the stem fair was which Design will produce the most voltage. We pick this idea because we want to make project that related to voltages and when we research we saw a wind turbine picture and we got a idea. We think turbine that is large and big will produce most voltages. Our plan is First, 3D designs the our wind turbine Second, 3D print that designs and Third, compare the different designs. We actually order the 12v motor and we use multimeter and wite to find how much voltage are containing for different designs. We can improve as make more different design for very specefic things and see its effect a lot or less. 
            All of our team was good at their work and we worked very well!</p>
